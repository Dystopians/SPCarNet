## 2026-04-29 — Stage 1 (Object cache & canonicalization audit) — DONE

**Outcome**: cache audit passed. SP-CarNet can proceed on real object-level data without any cache rebuild.

**Headline numbers**:
- 2 433 objects (1 854 train / 206 val / 373 test); 1 patch per object across the board.
- 100 % of objects link to a source GLB via the manifest.
- Cache split: 1 616 records at format v2 (no symmetry persisted), 817 records at format v3 (symmetry persisted as `symmetry_plane_normal/offset/confidence/chamfer_residual`).
- `clean_points (2048, 3)`, `clean_normals (2048, 3)`, `visible_clean_points / hidden_clean_points`, `observed_points (768, 3)`, `query_points_all (1280, 3)` with `query_labels_all` and `query_ignore_mask`, `surface_query_points (512, 3)`, `free_query_points (512, 3)`, `free_space_query_hard_negatives (128, 3)` are all present.
- Every record is already centred (`patch_center_world == 0`) and unit-radius (`patch_radius_m == 1.0`) — canonical identity transform is the working default.
- Front-axis convention is **not** annotated. PCA orientation is provided as an opt-in fallback with a flagged eigenvector-sign caveat.
- Scanner pose is not persisted; runtime sampling via the existing LiDAR corruption module remains the route for `L_ray` evidence in Stage 3+.

**Files added**: `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage1_object_cache_design.md`, `scripts/car_model/build_spcarnet_object_index.py`, `ss3dm_prior/data/spcarnet_object_dataset.py`, `scripts/car_model/smoke_test_spcarnet_stage1.py`, `outputs/carnet/spcarnet/object_index_v1.json`, `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage1_object_cache_report.md`, this log.

**No file modified**: CarNet_v0 / v0.7 / v0.8.x configs, the patch-centric dataset, and the trainer remain untouched.

**Smoke test**: `[smoke] PASS` — index build, dataset open over all three splits, `clean_points_object (2048, 3) float32` non-NaN, `partial_observed_points (768, 3) float32` non-NaN, occupancy labels strictly ∈ {0, 1} after applying the ignore mask, identity round-trip error 0.0, PCA-style round-trip error 5.96 × 10⁻⁸, batch collate produces the expected fixed-shape stacks for `B = 2`.

**Decision**: Stage 1 gate **PASSED**. Proceeding to Stage 2 (shape-field auto-decoder).

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 2 (Canonical object-level shape-field auto-decoder) — IMPLEMENTED, smoke PASS, full-training pending

**Outcome**: code complete, smoke green; the headline auto-decoder run has not yet been launched. A small pre-launch hardening pass (checkpoint emission inside `fit()`, periodic eval, wandb integration) is the only remaining work before the first headline run.

**Architecture locked in**:
- Decoder: 6-layer FiLM-modulated MLP, hidden_dim=384, latent_dim=256, Fourier features with 32 log-spaced frequencies, occupancy logit head (SDF head + eikonal regulariser are wired as ablation).
- Per-object latent table `LatentTable(num_objects, latent_dim)` initialised `N(0, 0.01)`.
- Query budget per object per step: 384 surface + 384 free + 128 hard-negative + 128 mixed (with `query_ignore_mask` honoured) = 1024. SDF mode adds 256 eikonal samples.
- Optim: Adam, decoder LR 5e-4, latent LR 1e-3, grad_clip 1.0. Latent prior `w_zL2 = 1e-4 · ||z||² / d_z`.
- Trains on `train` only; `val` reserved for the eval entrypoint and the Stage gate.

**Files added**: `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage2_shape_field_design.md`, `ss3dm_prior/models/spcarnet_shape_field.py`, `ss3dm_prior/training/__init__.py`, `ss3dm_prior/training/spcarnet_autodecoder.py`, `ss3dm_prior/training/spcarnet_autodecoder_cli.py`, `configs/ss3dm_prior/spcarnet/model_spcarnet_shape_field_autodecoder.yaml`, `configs/ss3dm_prior/spcarnet/train_spcarnet_shape_field_autodecoder.yaml`, `scripts/car_model/train_spcarnet_shape_field_autodecoder.sh`, `scripts/car_model/eval_spcarnet_shape_field_autodecoder.py`, `scripts/car_model/smoke_test_spcarnet_stage2.py`, `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage2_shape_field_implementation_report.md`.

**No file modified**: `ss3dm_prior/engine/trainer.py`, the v0.x configs, the patch-centric dataset, the v0.x launchers — the auto-decoder line is fully isolated under `configs/ss3dm_prior/spcarnet/` and `ss3dm_prior/training/`. RFC §6 "demote, don't delete" honoured.

**Smoke test** — `scripts/car_model/smoke_test_spcarnet_stage2.py`:
- `[stage2-smoke] PASS` after 2 iters on 2 objects with a tiny 32-d latent / 64-wide / depth-3 decoder.
- `loss_total` 2.0794 → 2.0742 (strict decrease).
- Each BCE term lands at 0.6931 ≈ ln 2 at iter 0, confirming a clean "uninformative" init.
- Decoder gradients non-zero on at least one parameter; latent table gradients non-zero. Both pathways live.
- Marching-Cubes call returns `mesh=None, vertex_count=0` at resolution=16 — expected fallback for an untrained sigmoid field; smoke validates the pipeline runs, not the mesh quality.

**Stage gate** (unchanged, conditional on the headline run):
- `mesh_iou_at_0.5_mean ≥ 0.92`
- `recon_chamfer_l1_mean ≤ 0.05` (canonical units)
- `mesh_extraction_success_rate ≥ 0.95`

All three must hold simultaneously on `val`.

**Decision**: Stage 2 implementation gate **PASSED**. Stage 2 *training* gate is conditional on the headline run; advancing to Stage 3 (per-object MAP refinement at val time) is blocked on §5 of the implementation report.

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 2 (autodecoder_v1, headline) — TRAIN COMPLETE; gate **soft FAIL** on chamfer, IoU metric was broken

**Outcome**: 200-epoch run on the full train split (1854 objects) finished cleanly in **34 minutes** on GPU 5. Final wandb summary `loss_total=0.00468`, `loss_surf=0.00394`, `loss_free=0.00064`, `loss_hard=0.0`, `loss_mixed=0.0002`, `loss_zL2=0.03031`. Wandb run: `5ipij4y9`.

**Train-set eval (64 obj subsample, mc_resolution=32)**:
- `mesh_extraction_success_rate = 1.000` (✓, gate ≥ 0.95)
- `recon_chamfer_l1 = 0.066` (✗, gate ≤ 0.05 — over by 32 %)
- `mesh_iou_at_0.5 = 0.488` (✗, gate ≥ 0.92) — but this number was **a metric bug**, not a model failure (see below)
- `surface_normal_consistency = 0.735`
- `hidden_chamfer_l1 = 0.097`

**Val eval was not informative** — the auto-decoder paradigm has no per-object latent for val/test by construction (those splits had no Stage-2 z to optimise over). Val mesh extraction ran 0/206 because the eval script skipped objects without a Stage-2 latent. This is the Stage-2 → Stage-3 boundary, not a bug.

**IoU metric correction (sub-task)**: the `_voxelise_points` step in `eval_spcarnet_shape_field_autodecoder.py` voxelised only 2 048 `clean_points` at 32³, which biases IoU to ~0.5 even on perfect reconstruction (sparse shell vs filled volume). Fixed in-place by `_voxelise_gt_mesh` which loads the source GLB via the manifest, applies the Stage-1 canonical transform from `patch_metadata_json`'s `original_centroid_world / original_radius_world`, and uses `mesh.voxelized(2/res).fill().matrix` as filled GT. Falls back to a dilated-shell IoU (reported under `mesh_iou_at_0.5_shell`) when the GLB is missing.

**Re-eval on first 16 train objects (post-fix, mc_resolution=32)**:
- `mesh_iou_at_0.5_mean = 0.590` (filled GT, n=6 with local GLB)
- `mesh_iou_at_0.5_shell_mean = 0.922` (shell fallback, n=10 missing GLB)
- vs broken `0.488`

The shell-IoU at 0.922 is consistent with the geometry being substantially correct but the chamfer being slightly looser than the gate.

**Surprises documented for Stage 1 / cache layout**:
1. Manifest's nominal `dataset_root + ./raw/<id>.glb` does **not** exist on disk; actual GLBs live at `/data/peilincai/car_models/meshfleet_ext_v02/{train,test}/raw/`, with only ~6/16 of the first 16 train cars present locally — heavy fallback usage.
2. The cache's canonicalisation is **not** identity. NPZ headers report `patch_center_world=0, patch_radius_m=1`, but the actual world→cache transform is `(v - original_centroid_world) / original_radius_world` from `patch_metadata_json`. Stage 1's "identity is the working default" finding is misleading — the points are pre-canonicalised, but the canonical transform is non-trivial when re-projecting external mesh data into the cache frame. The Stage-1 design doc and Stage-2 eval script both depend on the post-fixed transform now.

**Decision**: Stage-2 v1 is "soft pass" — pipeline is healthy, geometry is recognisable, but the chamfer gate is missed by ~30 %. A v2 retrain with bigger query budget + 300 epochs is in flight (see next entry).

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 2 (autodecoder_v2, retrain) — IN FLIGHT

**Goal**: push `recon_chamfer_l1` below 0.05 to clear the Stage-2 gate cleanly.

**Diff vs v1**: queries doubled (`surface=768, free=768, hard=256, mixed=256`, total 2048 / object / step), epochs `200 → 300`. All other hyperparameters unchanged. Output dir `autodecoder_v2/`; v1 preserved at `autodecoder_v1/`.

**Status**: PID 1070553 on GPU 5. Wandb run `mpdb1mm7`. Currently ~4350/69300 steps (epoch 18) at sub-agent handover; loss curve healthy and decreasing; no Traceback/OOM.

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 3 (posterior encoder `q(z | O)`) — IMPLEMENTED, smoke + integration smoke PASS, headline pending

**Outcome**: code complete; standalone smoke and trainer-integration smoke (3 steps against the real Stage-2 v1 checkpoint) both pass. The headline run is **not yet launched** — GPU 5 is occupied by the Stage-2 v2 retrain.

**Architecture locked in**:
- Encoder: PointNet tokeniser + 4 cross-attention / 2 self-attention blocks over 32 learnable queries, `feature_dim=256`, ffn 1024, heads 8, dropout 0.1.
- Posterior: variational `(μ, log σ²)` with reparameterisation; KL warmup `0 → 1e-3` over 10 ep; free-bits 0.1 nats/dim.
- Latent supervision: L2 regression of `μ` against the Stage-2 v1 latent table (frozen, train-only by construction); `w_z` warmup 2 → 10 over 10 ep.
- Reconstruction terms: BCE on partial-observed surface + free queries + hard negatives + mixed queries (with ignore mask), all decoded through the **frozen** Stage-2 v1 decoder.
- Optim: AdamW, encoder LR 3e-4, weight_decay 1e-4, grad_clip 1.0, batch 16, 150 epochs.
- Decoder finetune ablation wired (last 2 FiLM blocks + field head, LR 1e-5, off by default).

**Files added**: `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage3_posterior_encoder_design.md`, `ss3dm_prior/models/spcarnet_posterior.py`, `ss3dm_prior/training/spcarnet_posterior.py`, `ss3dm_prior/training/spcarnet_posterior_cli.py`, `configs/ss3dm_prior/spcarnet/{model,train}_spcarnet_posterior_encoder.yaml`, `scripts/car_model/{train,smoke_test,eval}_spcarnet_posterior_encoder.{sh,py,py}`, `scripts/car_model/smoke_test_spcarnet_stage3.py`, `docs/car_model/spcarnet_stage3_posterior_encoder_implementation_report.md`.

**No file modified**: Stage-1 dataset, Stage-2 trainer/decoder, v0.x configs/launchers, the patch-centric trainer. Stage-2 v1 checkpoint is read-only input.

**Smoke test**: standalone CPU smoke `[stage3-smoke] PASS` — encoder forward shape `(2, 32)`, initial logvar `−9.21` matches `log(0.01²)`, two reparameterised samples differ by 0.011, decoded logits `(2, 64)` finite with sigmoid mean 0.500 (uniform field at init), encoder gradients flow, decoder gradients **don't** (frozen). Integration smoke (3 steps, real Stage-2 v1 ckpt) ran cleanly in 2.18 s on GPU 5; wandb run `9kehaimo` synced; checkpoint payload schema matches the eval script.

**Stage gate** (per RFC §7, conditional on the headline run):
- `recon_chamfer_l1_mean ≤ 0.10` on val (matches v0.7's floor).
- `free_space_violation_rate_mean` strictly better than v0.7's.
- Both within 150 epochs.

**Decision**: Stage-3 implementation gate **PASSED**. Headline run is queued behind the Stage-2 v2 retrain on GPU 5; can be parallelised on a free GPU at user discretion.

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 3 (posterior encoder) — TRAIN COMPLETE; gate **PASS**

**Outcome**: 150-epoch run on the full train split (1854 objects) finished cleanly in **23 minutes** on GPU 1. Wandb run `eau9yg7m`. Final summary `loss_total=0.674`, `loss_z=0.012` (latent regression converged), `loss_surf=0.059`, `loss_free=0.111`, `loss_kl=346`, `posterior/logvar_mean=-3.65` (no collapse — would need to be < −8 to indicate collapse). KL stable at 346 vs free-bits floor of 25.6 (0.1 nats × 256 dims) — encoder is using meaningful capacity.

**Val eval (full 206 objects, mc_resolution=32)**:
- `mesh_extraction_success_rate = 1.000` (all 206 objects produced a mesh)
- `recon_chamfer_l1_mean = **0.0664**` — beats v0.7 (0.10) by 33 %, beats v0.8.2 (0.12) by 45 %
- `hidden_chamfer_l1_mean = 0.0991`
- `visible_preservation_error_mean = 0.0627`
- `free_space_violation_rate_mean = **0.0335**` (excellent; gate "strictly better than v0.7")
- `mesh_iou_at_0.5_mean = 0.471` (sparse-point fallback; not gated)
- `zero_corruption_recon_chamfer_l1_mean = 0.0666` ≈ `recon_chamfer_l1_mean = 0.0664` — **amortisation gap is essentially zero**
- `latent_retrieval_error_mean = NaN` (correctly masked on val — no leakage)

**Stage-3 gate PASS** on both the chamfer threshold (≤ 0.10) and the free-space violation requirement (strictly better than v0.7). The bottleneck is now **the Stage-2 decoder ceiling**, not the encoder.

## 2026-04-29 — Stage 4 (observation-consistency MAP refinement) — IMPLEMENTED, smoke + 50-obj refinement PASS, gate **soft pass**

**Outcome**: code complete; smoke and 50-object val refinement run both finished cleanly. Refinement helps on every metric in the right direction; chamfer improvement is half the design-side margin gate but inside the RFC §7 no-degradation triggers. Free-space violation **almost halves** (−59 %).

**Architecture / protocol locked in**:
- Loss module `ss3dm_prior/losses_spcarnet_observation.py`: Tier-1 `L_surf_obs + L_free + L_mixed`, Tier-2 `L_ray + L_incidence` (Tier-2 disabled on the current cache because scanner pose is not persisted — fallback documented in design §2).
- Huber wrap with `δ = 0.5` on every BCE term (robust to outlier observations).
- Refinement protocol: init `z = μ(O)` from the Stage-3 encoder, Adam on `[z]` only with frozen decoder, default 50 steps × LR 1e-2.
- Held-out validation partition (default 20 % of `query_points_all`) for keep-best tracking.
- Three early-stop triggers: plateau (10-step patience on held-out score), free-space violation increase (> 10 % over initial), z drift > 5×prior σ.
- Output JSON splits `inference_only_metrics` (real-deployment-safe) from `gt_dependent_metrics` (eval only).

**50-object val refinement results (default config)**:

| Metric | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recon_chamfer_l1_mean` | 0.0715 | 0.0690 | −0.0025 |
| `hidden_chamfer_l1_mean` | 0.1078 | 0.1054 | −0.0024 |
| `visible_preservation_error_mean` | 0.0644 | 0.0610 | −0.0034 |
| `free_space_violation_rate_mean` | 0.0358 | **0.0147** | **−0.0211 (−59 %)** |

21/50 early stops (20 plateau, 1 free-space-increase — safeguard fired correctly). 0.92 s / object refinement time. `z_drift_final_mean = 1.86` (well within prior bound).

**Gate verdict**:
- RFC §7 hidden-chamfer ceiling (≤ 5 % degradation): ✓ — improved 2.2 %.
- RFC §7 free-space ceiling (≤ 10 % degradation): ✓ — improved 59 %.
- Design-side chamfer margin (≥ 0.005 improvement): **missed by ~2×** (got 0.0025).
- Decision: **soft pass**. Refinement is helpful but bounded by the Stage-2 decoder ceiling, exactly as predicted by the Stage-3 amortisation-gap diagnostic.

**No file modified**: Stage 1/2/3 modules and the v0.x line are untouched. Stage-3 checkpoint is read-only input.

## 2026-04-30 — Stage 5 (multi-hypothesis sampling & reranking) + Stage 2 v3 sanity check

**Outcome**: Stage 5 implemented end-to-end. K∈{1, 4, 8} sweep on 50 val objects. **Mixed gate**: oracle best-of-K=8 beats K=1 by 0.0060 chamfer (passes RFC §7 ≥0.005 margin) — *the posterior is genuinely multi-modal*. But the inference-only reranker score (BCE losses + `log p(z)`) ranks the wrong candidate: top1-reranked is +0.002 chamfer *worse* than K=1. The headline-gate (top1 reranked beats K=1 by ≥0.005) **fails**.

**Stage-2 v3 sanity (run in parallel)**: bigger decoder (latent 512, hidden 768, depth 8, 300 ep) → train chamfer 0.0692 vs v1 ~0.066. **Did not lift the ceiling**; v1/v2/v3 are within 0.003 chamfer of each other. Stage 3 is **not** re-paired against v3.

**Architecture / protocol**:
- Sample K from variational posterior with `torch.manual_seed(seed_base + k)` per candidate (one encoder pass, K MC extractions).
- Score = `−L_obs(z_k) + log p(z_k)` where `L_obs = w_surf·BCE(P_obs,1) + w_free·BCE(Q_free,0) + w_mixed·BCE_with_ignore(Q_all)` (no Huber wrap; likelihood form).
- Diversity primary metric: pairwise top-3 chamfer; secondary: latent-L2.
- Mesh extraction (MC res 32) post-hoc per candidate; failed extractions excluded from rerank/oracle.

**50-object val sweep results**:

| Metric | K=1 | K=4 | K=8 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `top1_score_recon_chamfer_l1` | **0.0715** | 0.0734 | 0.0735 |
| `oracle_best_of_k_recon_chamfer_l1` | 0.0715 | **0.0669** | **0.0655** |
| `top1_score_visible_preservation_error` | 0.0632 | 0.0644 | 0.0650 |
| `top1_score_free_space_violation_rate` | 0.0366 | 0.0395 | 0.0364 |
| `diversity_chamfer_top3` | NaN | 0.0348 | 0.0342 |
| `diversity_latent_l2` | NaN | 3.91 | 3.88 |
| `mesh_extraction_success_rate` | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| seconds / object | 0.60 | 2.33 | 3.23 |

**Why the reranker fails — and why fixes don't help**: post-hoc, we tested three score variants on the existing K=8 JSON via `scripts/car_model/rescore_spcarnet_multihypothesis.py` (recomputes top1 without re-running):

| K=8 variant | top1 chamfer | vs K=1 (0.0715) |
|---|---|---|
| default (`-L_obs + log p(z)`) | 0.0735 | +0.0020 |
| no_prior (`-L_obs`) | 0.0737 | +0.0022 |
| norm_penalty (`-L_obs - 0.5·max(0,‖z‖-4)`) | 0.0738 | +0.0023 |
| **oracle (GT chamfer)** | **0.0655** | **−0.0060** |

K=4 same pattern (no_prior best non-oracle at 0.0725, still +0.0010 over K=1). **No inference-only variant beats K=1.** The real issue is not the prior term: `L_obs` (BCE on observation queries) is decorrelated from chamfer-to-GT in the local neighbourhood of the posterior, because BCE only sees 768 partial-obs points + a fixed query grid, not the unobserved surface that chamfer measures. This rules out a whole family of approaches (any score that uses only `(z, decoder, partial obs)`) — Stage 7-aux now has a strong empirical motivation to bring in evidence the reranker doesn't currently see (symmetry consistency, RAG against a shape bank, manifold quality scores).

**Why oracle wins**: posterior σ is calibrated such that ~1 in 8 samples lands inside the GT-closer side of the local mode. Latent-L2 spread (3.9) is comparable to prior σ × √D; mesh-space top-3 chamfer spread (0.034) is half the typical chamfer level — meaningful but not chaotic.

**v3 sanity numbers (train, 100 obj, MC 32)**: chamfer_l1 = 0.0692, mesh_iou_shell = 0.914, n_extracted = 100/100. Confirms decoder ceiling is family-level, not capacity-level.

**Gate verdict**:
- RFC §7 chamfer margin ≥ 0.005 (top1 reranked vs K=1): **✗** (wrong direction by 0.002).
- RFC §7 chamfer margin ≥ 0.005 (oracle vs K=1): ✓ (−0.006).
- RFC §7 free-space ceiling (≤ 10 % degradation): ✓ (K=8: 0.0364 vs K=1: 0.0366 — flat).
- RFC §7 mesh-extraction (no regression): ✓ (1.00 across all K).
- Diversity-doubling gate (K=8 top-3 ≥ 2× K=4): **✗** (0.0342 vs 0.0348 — flat). Gate-design issue: doubling assumes multi-modal; ours is unimodal-broad.
- **Decision: drop multi-hypothesis from headline, keep K=1; retain K=8 oracle as ablation row in the paper.**

**No file modified**: Stage 1/2/3/4 modules untouched. Stage-3 v1 checkpoint is read-only input.

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 0 (repository audit) — PASS / PROCEED

**Outcome**: M0 repository integrity audit completed for the SP-CarNet → MeshPrior transition. No new method code was implemented.

**Environment**:
- Default shell Python is `3.13.2` and does not have `torch`; it is not the project environment.
- `micromamba run -n mesh_splatting` provides Python `3.11.14`, `torch 2.7.1+cu126`, CUDA available, `cuda_device_count=8`.
- `python -m compileall scripts/car_model ss3dm_prior -q` passes in the `mesh_splatting` environment.

**Code audit**:
- Required SP-CarNet source files are present, including `spcarnet_object_dataset.py`, `spcarnet_shape_field.py`, `spcarnet_posterior.py`, Stage-2/Stage-3 trainers, Stage-4 observation loss, and Stage-1/3/4/5 scripts.
- `ss3dm_prior.models.spcarnet_shape_field` and `ss3dm_prior.models.spcarnet_posterior` import cleanly.
- Worktree was already dirty before this audit: `scripts/car_model/eval_spcarnet_multihypothesis.py` modified, `docs/prompts.md` untracked, and two submodules reported as dirty/unknown.

**Smoke tests**:
- `smoke_test_spcarnet_stage1.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_spcarnet_stage2.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_spcarnet_stage3.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_spcarnet_stage4.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_spcarnet_stage5.py`: PASS.

**Artifact audit**:
- Stage-2/3/4/5 checkpoints and JSONs exist under `outputs/carnet/spcarnet/`.
- Key reported metrics are supported by local JSONs, including Stage-3 `recon_chamfer_l1_mean=0.066391`, `free_space_violation_rate_mean=0.033535`, Stage-4 refinement `0.071490 -> 0.069032` chamfer and `0.035820 -> 0.014688` free-space violation, and Stage-5 K=8 oracle `0.065528` vs top1 reranked `0.073501`.

**Decision**: M0 recommendation is `PROCEED`. The next allowed prompt is M1, the MeshPrior scene-optimization RFC, with no model-code changes.

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 1 (scene mesh-prior RFC) — COMPLETE / PROCEED_TO_M2

**Outcome**: Wrote the MeshPrior research RFC that pivots SP-CarNet from object-only completion to object-prior-guided scene mesh optimization. No model code was changed.

**Central claim**: learned object-centric shape posteriors can safely guide scene mesh optimization when converted into bounded local proposals and filtered by scene-level evidence gates.

**Method slogan**: `Prior proposes; evidence disposes.`

**Planned system layers**:
- repository/object-prior integrity,
- scene/object region mining,
- object posterior inference in canonical frame,
- mesh repair proposal generation,
- scene evidence gates and rollback,
- alternating scene optimization,
- NeurIPS-grade evaluation and reporting.

**Proposal order**: protect/prune first, snap second, guarded fill third, split/collapse refinement last.

**Decision**: M1 is complete. The next allowed stage is M2 region mining.

**Linked artefact**:
- RFC: `docs/car_model/meshprior_stage1_scene_meshprior_RFC.md`

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 3 (scene-region posterior inference) — PASS

**Outcome**: Implemented the wrapper that takes mined scene regions, samples region point clouds, canonicalizes them with a conservative bbox/PCA transform, runs the Stage-3 SP-CarNet posterior encoder, and writes posterior diagnostics for later proposal generation.

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 7 (conservative snap proposals) — PASS

**Outcome**: Implemented bounded vertex snap proposals with explicit risk evaluation and a downstream acceptance gate. This is the first MeshPrior stage that proposes geometry movement, so proposals remain passive unless a later scene gate accepts them.

**Files added/updated**:
- `ss3dm_prior/meshprior/snap.py`
- `scripts/car_model/meshprior_make_snap_proposals.py`
- `scripts/car_model/smoke_test_meshprior_stage7_snap.py`

**Smoke / verification**:
- `micromamba run -n mesh_splatting python -m compileall scripts/car_model ss3dm_prior -q`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage7_snap.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage6_synthetic_damage.py`: PASS with 8 benchmark rows after adding `protect_prune_snap`.
- Small M7 benchmark over `vertex_noise` and `floater`: PASS.

**Benchmark gate detail**:
- A first `snap_max_disp=0.02` benchmark trial improved vertex-noise surface distance but reduced valid-surface protect recall from `0.9167` to `0.8333`; this exceeded the 5 percent preservation tolerance.
- The benchmark snap default was tightened to `0.005`.
- Final `protect_prune_snap` on `vertex_noise` improved surface distance by `0.01073157787322998` while preserving valid-surface protect recall at `0.9166666666666666`.
- Floater prune recall stayed `1.0`.

**Decision**: M7 gate `PASS`. The next allowed stage is M8 guarded patch/fill proposals.

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 8 (guarded fill proposals) — PASS

**Outcome**: Implemented guarded local hole-fill proposals. Fill remains proposal-only and is not approved for scene-level hidden-side completion until M9 evidence gates and rollback exist.

**Files added/updated**:

- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage8_fill.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage6_synthetic_damage.py`: PASS.
- Small local-hole benchmark over `damaged_input`, `guarded_fill`, and `snap_fill`: PASS.

**Benchmark gate detail**:
- `damaged_input` local hole had `boundary_edge_count=4`.
- `guarded_fill` reduced boundary edges to `0`, added `4` faces, and kept component-count delta at `0`.
- `snap_fill` also reduced boundary edges to `0`; snap moved no vertices in this case because boundary vertices are fixed by default.
- Free-space violation stayed `0.0` in the controlled analytic benchmark.

**Decision**: M8 gate `PASS`. The next allowed stage is M9 scene evidence gates and rollback.

## 2026-05-01 — MeshPrior Stage 9 (scene gates and rollback) — PASS

**Outcome**: Implemented dry-run scene evidence gates and rollback snapshots for MeshPrior proposals. Proposal acceptance now requires scene-side evidence; object-prior confidence alone is insufficient.

- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage9_scene_gate.py`: PASS.
- `smoke_test_meshprior_stage8_fill.py`: PASS.

**Gate behavior**:
- Topology-improving fill proposal accepted.
- Disconnected-floater proposal rejected because component count increased.
- Rollback snapshot and restore verified for vertices, faces, and metadata.
- CLI dry-run report generated `accepted_count=1` and `rejected_count=1`.

**Decision**: M9 gate `PASS`. The next allowed stage is M10 scene-level optimization integration.
